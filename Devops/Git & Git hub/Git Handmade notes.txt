  What is a Version Control System (VCS)?
   A Version Control System is a software tool that helps developers track and manage changes to source code or any files over time. 
   It allows you to:

    1. Save different versions of your project.
     
    2. Collaborate with others.
     
    3. Revert to previous versions if something breaks.
     
    4. See who made what changes and when.
