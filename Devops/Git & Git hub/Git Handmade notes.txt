  What is a Version Control System (VCS)?
   A Version Control System is a software tool that helps developers track and manage changes to source code or any files over time. 
   It allows you to:

    1. Save different versions of your project.
     
    2. Collaborate with others.
     
    3. Revert to previous versions if something breaks.
     
    4. See who made what changes and when.
	
	
	Issue version control system resolved are:
	
	 1. Sharing of code.
	 2. Versioning
	 
	
  Centrailized vs Decentralized
 
  Centralized: A centralized system is one where a single central authority (or unit) manages the entire system and controls all decisions,
               resources, and data processing.
			   
			   
  Decentralized: A decentralized system distributes control, processing, or decision-making across multiple independent or semi-autonomous units.



  What is fork?
  fork is a copy of repository that lives under your own user account. It allows you to freely modify the project without affecting 
  the original repository  
  
  What is Git and Git Hub?
  Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) that helps you track changes in files, especially code. 
  It allows multiple developers to work on the same project without overwriting each other's changes.
  
  GitHub: GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories online and adds collaboration tools on top. 
  Itâ€™s like a social network for code + cloud storage for your Git projects.
  
  Git commands:
  
  git init:                                Initialize a new Git repository
  git status:                              Show modified files and their state
  git add <file> or git add . :            Add a specific file to the staging area or Add all files to staging
  git commit -m "your message" :           Save your changes with a message.
  git log:                                 View commit history
  git diff :                               View differences between working files and staged files
  git push -u origin main                  Push it to Github repo
  
  what is branch?
  A branch is essentially a separate line of development. It allows multiple developers to work on different 
  features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase (often called the main or master branch).
  
  Advantages:
  1. Isolated Envirnament.
  2. Parallel Development.
  3. merge Later.
  
  Types of branching stratagy:
  
  1. Master or main branch
  2. Feature branch
  3. Release branch
  4. Hot fix branch
